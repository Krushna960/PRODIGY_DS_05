# Task-05: Traffic Accident Analysis

## Objective
To analyze traffic accident data and identify key patterns and contributing factors using exploratory data analysis.

## Dataset
US Accidents Dataset containing information about accident severity, time, weather conditions, visibility, and road features.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection  
- Feature engineering on time attributes  
- Handling missing values  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Key Insights
- Accident frequency varies by time of day and day of week  
- Weather and visibility impact accident severity  
- Junctions and traffic signals are high-risk locations  

## Outcome
This task demonstrates how real-world traffic accident data can be analyzed to derive meaningful safety insights.
